title: "Highlights from TORUS 2022"

Now that TORUS is over and I've had some time to catch up on things in Lincoln, I thought I'd write up a quick summary of my highlights from participating in the 2022 field campaign. I was lucky enough to reprise my role from the 2019 field campaign as the near inflow mission lead, which means that I got to coordinate a team (usually) consisting of one UNL mobile mesonet and one CU vehicle to sample the variability in the near-storm environment using surface obs from the mobile mesonet and vertical profiles from windsondes launched by the CU team. This was slightly different from 2019, when the CU team was using a RAAVEN drone to collect their vertical profiles. I absolutely loved having this role in 2019, since it's usually where I'd be set up when chasing anyway, and I was excited to have it again this year.

## 2022 Highlights

TORUS 2022 started with the UNL team doing weather briefings for a pattern in which opportunities for organized, supercellular convection were few and far between. From May 17th through the 19th, we pursued a plume of recycled moisture through two marginal supercell setups, one in northern KS and the other in southern MN. Although neither day produced a targetable storm, it was a good opportunity for the team to shake the dust off in preparation for better days down the road.

(Pretty clouds, rainbows, and one marginal attempt at a supercell in MN from 5/19.)

After having most of the 20th and the 21st to rest in Lincoln, we were on the road for what I though would be a fairly marginal supercell setup in the TX panhandle. Luckily for us, it turned out I was very wrong: 5/23 was our best case for the whole project, with a chaotic series of storm mergers consolidating into a cyclic supercell shrouded in West TX dust that produced 8 tornadoes near Morton, TX. In the near inflow team, the nicely-gridded road network allowed us to launch windsondes in a variety of storm-relative locations to sample variability within the dust-choked inflow sector. As the main storm emerged from the initial convective demolition derby following CI, it rapidly transitioned from having a mainly flat, featureless base to having a sculpted mesocyclone reminiscent of the 5/21/2016 Leoti, KS supercell. During our wanderings in the inflow, that structure was frequently visible looming over the plumes of dust in the inflow, and we were even able to catch a brief glimpse of one of the tornadoes while we were moving from one windsonde launch site to another.

(The worst of the dust--at times visibility was nearly zero about two miles ahead of the meso and RFD)


The next day's setup was an upslope play in eastern NM and far western TX, and found us following a cluster of cells from Hobbs, NM to Midland, TX as they repeatedly tried and failed to organize into a single dominant supercell. Although no individual cell lasted terribly long, several of the individual supercells briefly looked impressive before being disrupted by collisions with new cells going up in their inflow. Near inflow operations were considerably more difficult this day, due to limited roads, an absurd abundance of pumpjacks and associated powerlines, and even a spooky sign indicating the presence of poisonous gas! On the 25th, with a quiet pattern in storm for the next few days, we made the long drive back to Lincoln.

After resting on the 26th, TORUS staged to North Platte on the 27th for what we thought would be a couple of days of operations. Little did we realize that the UNL team would be out for 20 days straight! The first few days of this stretch were somewhat frustrating, with a bust on the 28th (but plenty of fun exploring a park in North Platte with a zoo and a train museum), CI near sunset in the Sandhills on the 29th which produced a supercell that we couldn't target, and a moderate risk on the 30th in southern MN which devolved into a rapidly-moving QLCS instead of discrete supercells.

Our luck turned for the better on the 31st, with the intercept of two supercells (one marginally tornadic) on the OK-KS border near Arkansas City. These two storms had some briefly-spectacular structure, and I'd consider them pretty good specimens of the kind of structure you'd expect to see in a marginally tornadic environment characterized by LCLs which are juuuuuussst a bit too high and SRH which is juuussssst a bit too weak to sustain strong, tornadic low-level mesocyclones.

TORUS was next drawn to the TX panhandle for a couple of marginal setups which didn't quite pan out. However, the UNL team was able to spend a couple of days in Amarillo fixing some vehicle issues and getting our fill of Whataburger and delicious TX BBQ. On the 4th, we attempted to deploy on what appeared to be a favorable environment for supercells provided a sustained storm could develop in the northern TX Panhandle...but what developed was not exactly sustained, prompting a great limerick from someone on the project in SASSI (TORUS's situational awareness software). On the 5th, TORUS had a difficult choice between two targets in KS, one along a cooking outflow boundary near Dodge City and another along the warm front along the NE border. We chose the southern target...and were rewarded with sunburn waiting in a parking lot in Dodge for CI that never happened. Eventually, we decided to make a run for the northern target, only for the only targetable supercell in it to fire out of our range in NE. It's almost like forecasting severe convection is... * difficult * or something (LOL).

June 6th began both a string of several better chase days and a surprisingly long stay in North Platte for TORUS. Despite the limited Sandhills road network, we were able to get good deployments on two crisp LP supercells near the SD border on the 6th. I also got to encounter one of my absolute favorite weather phenomena on this chase--HAIL FOG!! Behind the second storm, a gossamer layer of hail fog hugged the grassy waves of the Sandhills and briefly dropped visibility in some low spots.

The 7th was a similarly successful day, as we sampled two supercells in an upslope regime in NE CO. The first storm produced some decent structure and some rather convincing gustnadoes, and the second storm had a really neat inflow tail / likely streamwise vorticity current (SVC) above an outflow boundary it was ingesting from the earlier storm. Several TORUS teams collected observations of this boundary / SVC, which will hopefully lead to some interesting analysis down the road.

A quiet pattern on the 8th allowed us to have a relaxing down day in North Platte before out next chase on the 9th. Once again, we were working on the approximately 4 paved roads in the Sandhills, but we still managed to collect data on two right-moving supercells (and one left-moving supercell between them). The left-mover produced a fascinating cyclonic gustnado (somewhat similar to the anticyclonic tornadoes occasionally found on the southern end of a RM supercell's RFD) which was witnessed by both the near inflow and left flank teams.

On the 10th, we drove up to Spearfish, SD to stage to a couple of days of potential supercells on the northern slopes of the Black Hills. Badlands National Park was on the way up there, and the whole UNL team was excited to stop and hike for a bit. Unfortunately, one of our scout vehicles got a flat tire on the way up, so we spent much of the day waiting for them and then trying to patch the tire at a gas station in Interior, SD. In the end, we did get to drive through the park and stop for a few photos. When combined with the time the UNL scout vehicle on the NRI project in 2018 got a flat tire in roughly the same area, the score is now Badlands 2-UNL scout tires 0.

The 11th and 12th both produced good deployment days on well-organized supercells along the northern and western slopes of the Black Hills in SD, WY, and far SE MT. The 11th was my first visit to MT and it did not disappoint, with a beautiful supercell south of Alzada that produced my favorite structure of the project and behaved nicely with the one road we had to work with to allow us to sample the inflow sector well with windsondes. The 12th produced a beast of a supercell which roared into Belle Fourche, SD with 3-inch hail driven by 80-90mph winds. We sampled it just south of Belle Fourche, with the near inflow and right flank windsonde teams launching a series of windsondes as the storm approached (with our last sonde launch sampling the edge of the RFD outflow), and the right flank CoMET catching a 91-mph wind gust SE of Belle Fourche later on as the storm moved past town.

The next several days held a few surprises for TORUS. The 13th ended up being a bust, as cells quickly went linear in western SD. On the 14th, we staged down to Kearney, NE for a potential setup in KS the next day...and the atmosphere decided to welcome us to town that evening with a train of nocturnal supercells producing severe hail. Finally, the setup for the 15th in KS fell apart, so the UNL team headed back home to Lincoln to wrap up the project. Our trip down I80 took us through a swath of devastating hail damage from the previous night's supercells, with miles of crops flattened and trees stripped of leaved from large wind-driven hail.
