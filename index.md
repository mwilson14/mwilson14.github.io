Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln working on assessing the impact of assimilating targeted drone, 
mobile mesonet, and radiosonde observations on storm-scale ensemble forecasts of supercells. I'm also working on developing 
automated algorithms to detect and quantify supercell dual-pol signatures in real time.
