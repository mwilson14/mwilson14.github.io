I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Earth and Atmospheric Science department at the University of Nebrasksa-Lincoln. My PhD research focuses on evaluating the impact of assimilating targeted UAS, mobile mesonet, and radiosonde observations from TORUS on storm-scale ensemble forecasts of supercell storms. Other research interests of mine include examining what dual-pol signatures of supercells can tell us about these storms and their environments, developing automated algorithms to identify and quantify these signatures quickly for use by researchers and forecasters, and exploring how small-scale variations in storm environments in space and time affect the evolution of nearby supercells.

## Assimilating TORUS Observations into a Storm-Scale Ensemble

NWP forecasts of severe storms depend heavily on having accurate model initial conditions; however, storm evolution often depends on mesoscale features which may not be sampled well by our current observational network. Would forecast accuracy improve if we had dense, targeted observations around developing storms from UAS and other platforms? Which regions of the atmosphere (surface, PBL, or the free atmosphere above the PBL) might it be most helpful to have these observations in? This project seeks to take a first step toward answering some of these questions by assimilating TORUS observations in and around two supercells on 8 June 2019 into a storm-scale WRF ensemble using the Data Assimiation Research Testbed (DART). In a series of data denial experiments, the impact of assimilating TORUS UAS, mobile mesonet, and radiosonde observations from the surface, PBL, and free atmosphere on short-term storm-scale ensemble forecasts is explored for this case. Preliminary results presented at AMS 2022 indicated that assimilating the TORUS observations improved the representation of the first supercell's cold pool--stay tuned for a more in-depth examination of the impacts of the different observation subsets!
